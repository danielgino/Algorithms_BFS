# üìå Description
# Question 1
This Java program finds the best slot (white cell) on an N x N board that can be reached by all given robots, such that the total number of steps taken by all robots is minimized.

Robots (R) can only move on white slots (W) and must avoid black boxes (B). The algorithm uses Breadth-First Search (BFS) for each robot to compute the shortest distances to all accessible white cells.

‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run
Open the project in IntelliJ IDEA or any Java IDE.

Make sure the main class is set to:
question1.MainQuest1

Run the program (e.g., click "Run" or execute via terminal if compiled manually).

üì• Input (via console)
The program will prompt you to enter:

Board size (N) ‚Äì the board will be N x N

Number of Robots ‚Äì number of robots to place randomly on the board

Number of Black Boxes ‚Äì number of blocked cells (B) that robots cannot pass through

Note: Positions are chosen randomly at runtime.

üì§ Output
The generated board will be printed, using:

R = Robot

B = Black box (obstacle)

W = White slot (free cell)

After running the algorithm, you will see:

Total number of robots and black boxes

The best slot: a cell that all robots can reach with minimum total steps

The total sum of steps for all robots to reach that cell

The time complexity of the algorithm

# Question 2

### üå≥ Tree Diameter ‚Äì Question 2
Given an undirected tree T = (V, E) with n nodes, compute the diameter of the tree in linear time O(n).

The diameter of a tree is defined as the length of the longest shortest path between any two nodes.

### üí° Algorithm Overview
This program uses two BFS traversals to find the tree's diameter efficiently.

Steps:
Perform BFS from any arbitrary node (e.g., node 0).

Find the farthest node x from the starting point.

Perform another BFS starting from node x.

The maximum distance found in this second BFS is the tree's diameter.

Time Complexity:
Each BFS traversal takes O(n) time.

Therefore, the overall time is O(n).

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run
Open the project in IntelliJ (or any Java IDE).

Run the MainQuest2 class.

The tree is hardcoded as an adjacency list.

## Output
```
Node: 0 Connected to: [1]
Node: 1 Connected to: [0, 2, 3]
Node: 2 Connected to: [1]
Node: 3 Connected to: [1, 4]
Node: 4 Connected to: [3, 5]
Node: 5 Connected to: [4]

Total cost of O(N)
```

# Question 3

### üí° Algorithm Description
The algorithm follows this logic:

Choose an arbitrary starting vertex x.

Run BFS from x on the original graph G to check which nodes are reachable.

Reverse the graph G, meaning that for every edge u ‚Üí v in G, we add the edge v ‚Üí u in G'.

Run BFS from the same node x on the reversed graph G'.

If all nodes were reachable in both traversals, the graph is strongly connected.

Otherwise, it is not strongly connected.

This approach is based on the fundamental property of strong connectivity:
If a graph is strongly connected, then any node must be able to reach all others, and also be reachable from all others.

### üß† Time and Space Complexity
Reversing the graph: O(E)

Each BFS: O(V + E)

Overall time complexity: O(V + E)

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run the Program
Open the project in IntelliJ IDEA or any Java IDE.

Run the class: MainQuest3.

The graph is defined statically as an adjacency list in the code.

The program will print the structure of the graph and reversed graph, then output whether it is strongly connected.

## Graph Input
```
graph.get(0).add(1);
graph.get(1).add(2);
